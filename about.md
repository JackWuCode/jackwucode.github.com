##Who am I?
I'm not gonna answer the ultimate philosophy question here, it's just a main introdution of me. So if you're not interested, just close the window and do your own thing.

My name is Wu Wei in Chinese, Jack is my English name. Male, computer programmer, movie fans, fond of Python(the language not animal).

From 2009 to 2013, I studied [Computer Science](cs.nju.edu.cn) at [Nanjing University](www.nju.edu.cn).

Now I work at ctrip at Shanghai.


##More detail
I spent my four years in college to get to know computer, watch movies, stay in a relationship .
Really hate education system, that's why I choose to work after graduation instead of further education

##What is Jekyll?
As described on the offical site of [Jekyll](www.jekyllrb.com):
>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator.It takes a template directory
>containing raw test files in various formats, runs it through [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)
(or Textile) and Liquid converts, and spits out a complete, raedy-to-publish static website suitable for serving with your
>web server.

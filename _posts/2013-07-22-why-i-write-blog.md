## The Road to Blogging

It has been a long time since I intented to start my won blog.
Due to lack of money and other factors, this didn't happen until I find github pages which is convenient and free to build and host my blog. So,
many thanks to [github](http://www.github.com).

## Why I Write Blog?

There are many reasons why I write blog, the main one is, I think, recording my life.

## The Future of this Blog
Once started, there will be no stop. I would keep wirting and sharing until the day come when death take me and my blog apart.

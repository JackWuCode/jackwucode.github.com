## Blogs

I write blogs on github pages, which is a delight for guys like me who can't care less about building a website.

Topics in the posts includes computer knowledge, essays, and reviews. Recording my learning process is main  motivation for updating the blog, sharing knowledge is another one.

Enjoy your trip here.
